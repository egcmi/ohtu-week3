### Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
The goal is to get feedback on team process to determine how to proceed as the team moves forward.
Feedback is collected using a wheel poster divided into 5 sections: start, stop, continue, more of, less off.
This means the team responds to the questions "what should we start/stop/continue doing?" and "what should we do more/less of?".
The goal is finding out what works in the team/project/milestone and what not, so that things can be adjusted accordingly.
Each member of the team writes their own comments in the 5 sections on the poster.
If the group is large (>= 9 people) it can be further divided into subgroups.
Roles of team members can be taken into account when splitting the team, such that each subgroup comprises diffferent aspects of the project.
Members of subgroups also read other subgroup's posters, then discussion is open.
According to the poster(s) decisions must be taken for the next step/project.

### Glad, sad, mad
The goal is to collect feedback on how the team members felt about the project.
Each participant writes notes on observations, then they briefly describe them and place them on a board one participant at a time.
The board is split into 3 columns: glad, sad and mad.
Each note is placed in a column according to how the observation made the participant feel (glad/sad/mad).
Intuitively glad focuses on the positive aspects, whereas sad and mad focus on the negative aspects.
The distinction between sad and mad is that mad also covers external issues that might still impact the team.
The notes are grouped according to similarity.
Participants vote on the (grouped) issues to be discussed. Usually each participant has a limit of how many issues they can vote (e.g. max. 5 votes).
Finally discussion is open and issues are discussed in descending order of number of votes.
The discussion should focus on how to proceed in the next step.
The glad column can be a starting point to build upon.
The discussion goes on when all issues have been discussed or after the time limit (1 hour) is up.
